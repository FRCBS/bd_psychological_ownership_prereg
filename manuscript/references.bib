  abstract = {Given many nonprofit service organisations rely on volunteers to provide valued services to their communities, examining the factors that impact the retention and recruitment of volunteers is of central importance for the success and longevity of many community-based services. Psychological ownership is a phenomenon whereby objects that are not physically or legally possessed can be the target of ownership feelings. While such psychological ownership has been examined in the paid-employment literature as an antecedent for prosocial behaviours, there has been no examination of psychological ownership within the volunteering literature. As such, this paper examines the role of psychological ownership as a factor in volunteer retention for predominantly community-based nonprofit service organisations by examining how the sense of ownership over the nonprofit service provider affects volunteering attitudes and intentions. Alongside ownership, previous volunteering behaviours, and time pressures are also examined as contributing factors. Results indicate that volunteering does increase ownership perceptions, and those ownership perceptions have positive outcomes for volunteering behaviours. However, time pressure is a significant moderator of these relationships and different volunteering behaviours can be observed for high and low time-pressured volunteers.},

  abstract = {Summary Psychological ownership is increasingly recognized as a core feeling in the experience of work. Within jobs and the work context, there is a wide range of opportunities to experience psychological ownership. Yet empirical work on how feelings of ownership develop is lacking, and thus ways to develop psychological ownership in the workplace are not well understood. We explore the routes traveled to feelings of ownership by using job complexity as one example of work environment structure that affects the formation of psychological ownership. In two studies, we develop measures of the routes and confirm that perceived differences in one's work meaningfully predict psychological ownership. Collectively, the two studies provide insight into and offer suggestions for how ownership develops and ways in which managers might foster employee feelings of ownership toward their work.

  abstract = {The concept of role-identity salience plays a critical role in many contemporary discussions of the self-concept. It has also been invoked, in one form another, in a variety of other areas within sociology. However, there has been conspicuously little empirical investigation of the concept. This paper attempts to fill this void with an empirical examination of role-identity salience as it applies to the act of voluntary blood donation. The data are based on 658 responses to a mail questionnaire sent to a sample of blood donors. Analyses are organized into two sections. In the first section a number of hypotheses specifying correlates with salience of the blood donor role-identity are examined. Significant associations between salience and self-definition, a tendency to view other in terms of the role-identity, increased social relations premised on the role-identity, expectations from other, and future behavior, were found. In the second section, salience and the variables mentioned above are used to predict number of donations six months after completing the questionnaire. Results from a regression analysis find support for salience, self-defintion, and social relationships as significant predictors. Implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.}

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Interventions to retain existing donors are essential to increase the blood supply. Blood donor self-identity is proposed to motivate sustained donation behaviour. However, interventions to develop self-identity in the absence of donating blood are scarce. We propose that experiencing psychological ownership of a blood collection agency (BCA) may provide a potential avenue for fostering donor self-identity and subsequent sustained donation behaviour. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-five donor participants were recruited through Prolific Academic (n = 175) and an Australian online blood donor community group (n = 80), with an additional 252 non-donors recruited through Prolific Academic. Participants completed an online survey assessing donation behaviour, perceived psychological ownership of a BCA, self-identity and intentions to donate blood, amongst other constructs. Results: Consistent with our theoretical argument, psychological ownership was positively associated with self-identity, which, in turn, was positively associated with intentions to donate blood. Donation behaviour was positively associated with psychological ownership. Examination of psychological ownership by donation experience showed the expected relationship with committed donors having the strongest psychological ownership and non-donors having the weakest psychological ownership over a BCA. Conclusion: We provide initial support for the inclusion of psychological ownership within a model of sustained blood donation behaviour.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Although the need for whole blood is declining, so too are the number of first-time and repeat blood donors. To develop new recruitment and retention strategies, therefore, we need to draw on as wide a variation in blood donor motivations as possible. The primary aim of this study is to draw on a large survey of donors to develop a broad, theoretically instantiated typology of donor motivations to identify new and less common, yet practically important, motivations that have not been previously reported. Study Design and Methods Using data from the UK Blood Donor Survey run by NHS Blood and Transplant/Public Health England Epidemiology Unit (N = 61\,123 donors), we analyze fixed (N = 52\,225) and free (N = 8867) responses to develop a more comprehensive typology of blood donor motivations based on theories from the biology, psychology, philosophy, economics, and sociology of altruism. Results We identified 54 motivations, including a number of newly identified motivations, for blood donations which we organized into 12 superordinate categories (eg, “inspiration via moral elevation,” “perceived social closeness,” and “fungibility of donations”). These are linked to intervention suggestions such as donating blood in memoriam or donating blood as an alternative to other charitable acts. Conclusion We present the most comprehensive account of blood donor motivations to-date. This work also offers a structure for coding free-text responses, developing motivational measures, and identifying tangible interventions. Thus, we feel that this is a valuable resource for blood donor researchers, marketers, and policy makers.},

  abstract = {Incentives for blood donors are a much-debated strategy intended to ensure a sufficient supply of blood. Yet, there is a fundamental lack of knowledge about which incentives are offered by different blood collectors. We provide a comprehensive description of incentive policies for whole blood donors across 63 countries and 50 states of the United States. We collected data on incentive policies by conducting 2 surveys among representatives of blood collection establishments. Additionally, we integrated incentive data from an existing study and the World Health Organization (WHO). Lastly, we performed a web content analysis of blood collector websites and news releases to extend incentive data for the United States as well as underrepresented regions. We present descriptive analyses illustrating the type and value of incentives and their geographical distribution around the globe. Approximately half of the countries in our sample employ financial incentives, which include cash and tax benefits, but also less conventional incentives, such as healthcare supplements and raffles. Time off work is also commonly offered to blood donors and varies across blood collection establishments in duration and whether it is granted to all donors or only to those whose employer allows it. There is a geographical clustering of incentives, such that neighboring countries are more likely to employ similar incentives. This study provides insights into the strategies used for incentivizing blood donation and highlights the global diversity of incentive policies for whole blood donors. In stark contrast to WHO guidelines, half of the countries surveyed employ some kind of high-value incentive for blood donors. More realistic guidelines that are adapted to the local cultural and institutional context may be needed to maintain an adequate blood supply.},

The framework is centered on identity theory and includes both general and specific role identity as well as organizational variables. Data were obtained from two samples of volunteers for the American Cancer Society (ACS). Specific role identity as an ACS volunteer is predicted from general role identity and several factors related to perceived experiences in the organization. Specific role identity explains significant amounts of variance in the number of hours worked for ACS and other organizations as well as intent to remain an ACS volunteer. Results also suggest that volunteers may experience conflicts between the demands of their general and specific role identities. Finally, the effects of ACS role identity on volunteer behavior are compared with those of organizational commitment.}

This paper introduces the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS): A step-by-step procedure that researchers can follow to make a research project open and reproducible. This workflow intends to lower the threshold for adoption of open science principles. It is based on established best practices, and can be used either in parallel to, or in absence of, top-down requirements by journals, institutions, and funding bodies. To facilitate widespread adoption, the WORCS principles have been implemented in the R package worcs, which offers an RStudio project template and utility functions for specific workflow steps. This paper introduces the conceptual workflow, discusses how it meets different standards for open science, and addresses the functionality provided by the R implementation, worcs. This paper is primarily targeted towards scholars conducting research projects in R, conducting research that involves academic prose, analysis code, and tabular data. However, the workflow is flexible enough to accommodate other scenarios, and offers a starting point for customized solutions. The source code for the R package and manuscript, and a list of examplesof WORCS projects, are available at https://github.com/cjvanlissa/worcs.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Donor retention poses a significant problem to blood collection agencies around the world. Previous research using an augmented theory of planned behavior (TPB) approach has demonstrated that attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, moral norm, anticipated regret, donation anxiety from prior blood donations, and self-identity as a blood donor predicts experienced donors' intentions and that intentions, self-efficacy, moral norm, and anticipated regret may impact upon people's actual blood donation behavior. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Established blood donors (n{$\quad$}={$\quad$}263) completed questionnaires assessing standard TPB constructs, anticipated regret, moral norm, donation anxiety, and self-identity as a blood donor. Three months later, a second questionnaire assessing blood donation behavior in the intervening 3 months was mailed and returned by 182 donors. RESULTS: With structural equation modeling, the final augmented TPB model provided an excellent fit to the data and included a direct path from intention to behavior and indirect paths to behavior through intention for attitude, self-efficacy, and anticipated regret. Moral norm, donation anxiety, and donor identity indirectly predicted intention through attitude. In total, 51 percent of the variance in donors' attitudes, 86 percent of variance in donors' intentions, and 70 percent of the variance in donors' behavior were accounted for in the final model. CONCLUSION: An augmented TPB framework proved efficacious in determining the predictors of the intentions and behavior of established blood donors. Further, this framework highlighted the importance of considering in the future how donors' motivations for donating blood may evolve as a function of the number of prior donations.}

The study was concerned with the prediction of intention to engage in household recycling and reported recycling behaviour. A sample of 143 community residents participated in the study. It was prospective in design: measures of the predictors and intention were obtained at the first wave of data collection, whereas behaviour was assessed two weeks later. Selfidentity significantly predicted behavioural intention, a relationship that was not dependent on the extent to which the behaviour had been performed in the past. As expected, there was also evidence that the perceived norm of a behaviourally relevant reference group was related to behavioural intention, but only for participants who identified strongly with the group, whereas the relationship between perceived behavioural control (a personal factor) and intention was strongest for low identifiers.}
