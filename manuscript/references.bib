  abstract = {Background and Objectives: Interventions to retain existing donors are essential to increase the blood supply. Blood donor self-identity is proposed to motivate sustained donation behaviour. However, interventions to develop self-identity in the absence of donating blood are scarce. We propose that experiencing psychological ownership of a blood collection agency (BCA) may provide a potential avenue for fostering donor self-identity and subsequent sustained donation behaviour. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and fifty-five donor participants were recruited through Prolific Academic (n = 175) and an Australian online blood donor community group (n = 80), with an additional 252 non-donors recruited through Prolific Academic. Participants completed an online survey assessing donation behaviour, perceived psychological ownership of a BCA, self-identity and intentions to donate blood, amongst other constructs. Results: Consistent with our theoretical argument, psychological ownership was positively associated with self-identity, which, in turn, was positively associated with intentions to donate blood. Donation behaviour was positively associated with psychological ownership. Examination of psychological ownership by donation experience showed the expected relationship with committed donors having the strongest psychological ownership and non-donors having the weakest psychological ownership over a BCA. Conclusion: We provide initial support for the inclusion of psychological ownership within a model of sustained blood donation behaviour.},

  abstract = {Incentives for blood donors are a much-debated strategy intended to ensure a sufficient supply of blood. Yet, there is a fundamental lack of knowledge about which incentives are offered by different blood collectors. We provide a comprehensive description of incentive policies for whole blood donors across 63 countries and 50 states of the United States. We collected data on incentive policies by conducting 2 surveys among representatives of blood collection establishments. Additionally, we integrated incentive data from an existing study and the World Health Organization (WHO). Lastly, we performed a web content analysis of blood collector websites and news releases to extend incentive data for the United States as well as underrepresented regions. We present descriptive analyses illustrating the type and value of incentives and their geographical distribution around the globe. Approximately half of the countries in our sample employ financial incentives, which include cash and tax benefits, but also less conventional incentives, such as healthcare supplements and raffles. Time off work is also commonly offered to blood donors and varies across blood collection establishments in duration and whether it is granted to all donors or only to those whose employer allows it. There is a geographical clustering of incentives, such that neighboring countries are more likely to employ similar incentives. This study provides insights into the strategies used for incentivizing blood donation and highlights the global diversity of incentive policies for whole blood donors. In stark contrast to WHO guidelines, half of the countries surveyed employ some kind of high-value incentive for blood donors. More realistic guidelines that are adapted to the local cultural and institutional context may be needed to maintain an adequate blood supply.},
